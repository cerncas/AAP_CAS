# Optics Hands-On in Spa (Belgium), November 10-22 2024
*S. Kostoglou, G. Sterbini, M. Topp-Mugglestone*

During the [CAS 2024 in Spa](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1380440/) (Belgium), we will be using Python as scripting languages for the Optics Hands-On Lattice course.

This repository contains all material used during the course.
The repository is based on the material prepared and updated during previous courses (thanks to *W. Herr,  A. Latina, D. Gamba, H. Bartosik*).

- [student_instructions.md](./student_instructions.md) contains all information to get ready for the course. We kindly ask the student to read this document **before coming** to CAS to **prepare yourself** (and **your laptop**) for the course. 
- [lecturer_instructions.md](./lecturer_instructions.md) contains some useful for the lecturers. 
- The overleaf repository can be found at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrpgzczwhqfc#6cc685).

> **NOTE:** the material in this repository is expected to evolve over time thanks to the feedback received from you! Please don't hesitate to share your comments and suggestions!
